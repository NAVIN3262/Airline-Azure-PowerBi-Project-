# Airline-Azure-PowerBi-Project-
This project uses Azure services and Power BI to analyze airline flight data. A data pipeline is created with Azure Data Factory to move a CSV file from Blob Storage to a SQL Database, where it is analyzed with SQL queries. Power BI is then used to visualize trends in flight delays, cancellations, and on-time performance.
